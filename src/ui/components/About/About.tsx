      <p>
        Something about me ðŸš€ <br />I am a Software Engineering student
        passionate about programming and developing innovative solutions. With a
        specialization in databases and Big Data, I have acquired strong skills
        in various areas of computer science.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience includes the development of web and mobile applications,
        as well as backend projects using frameworks such as Django, FastAPI,
        and Flask. On the frontend, I have experience developing user interfaces
        using HTML, CSS, React, React-Native, and Angular, including TypeScript.
        Additionally, I hold certifications in network infrastructure with Cisco
        and have a solid foundation in technologies like Java, Python, C++, and
